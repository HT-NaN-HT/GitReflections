9. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- staging area can be viewed as a link between working directory and repository. 

- Initially, the working directory contains files of the project and the repository is empty before initializing.

- After initialization of git repository, files can be added to make commits however necessary.

- It is the stage where project history has started its creation.
