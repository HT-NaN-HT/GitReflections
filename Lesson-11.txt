11. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

- During an experimental coding stage.

- Implementing a new method without the problem of losing the working older version.

- Branches can be used to show the working version of the program, by checkingout the oldest working version.

- When we have bugged master version and updates to master version needs to be reflected in a branched experimental version.

- Compartmentalize work; Stop and work on something else if bored.
